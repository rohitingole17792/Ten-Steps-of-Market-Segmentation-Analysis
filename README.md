# In this project, as part of a five-member team, I was responsible for the Data Exploration phase, with a specific focus on Demographic and Consumer Behavior Analysis. My role involved analyzing the spending behaviors and preferences of male consumers, particularly identifying key factors that influence their choices for various products or services. I also worked on identifying high-value segments within the male consumer group, uncovering valuable insights to help inform targeted marketing strategies and business decisions. By exploring patterns in consumer behavior, I contributed to the overall goal of understanding and segmenting the target audience effectively.

# Techniques and Tools: Armed with Python, leveraging powerful libraries such as NumPy and Pandas, we embarked on a data-driven expedition. Our journey involved harnessing the potential of machine learning algorithms, notably employing k-means clustering to unearth valuable insights.
